# Hashing-value-program
This is project was made in my Final Year of Engineering College.
<br> </br>
Python script for hashing a password or message using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
This python program give feature to convert your Password into HASH Format and
also ask user to see if the hash value matches with the current value and is correctly implemented or not?
<br> </br>
For that user should enter the orginal password entered before and lastly the output will show, first and second password entered matched the hash value or not.

hash_password_or_message: This function takes an input string, creates a SHA-256 hash object, updates it with the bytes of the input string, and returns the hexadecimal digest of the hash.
main: This function welcomes the user, prompts for the password or message to be hashed, calls the hashing function, and prints the hashed result.
